# SmartBench

A B2B marketplace application solving the "Feast or Famine" labor cycle in the construction industry.

## Overview

SmartBench allows established non-union construction companies and solopreneurs to "lend" their idle, vetted W-2 employees to other companies. This ensures that:

- **Lending Companies** turn Fixed Costs (Payroll) into Variable Revenue during slow periods
- **Borrowing Companies** get on-demand access to the best qualified professionals

## Target Market

Solo contractors and small construction companies (typically 1-10 employees), where idle time represents a disproportionately high percentage of their workforce.

## Key Features (MVP)

- **Onboarding & Compliance**: KYB Verification, Insurance Vault, Digital Bench
- **Marketplace**: Short-Term and Long-Term bookings with Recall Rights
- **Financial Engine**: Credit Card and Net-Terms payments with Escrow
- **Field Operations**: Anti-Fraud Timekeeping, Granular Ratings, Babel Chat

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS

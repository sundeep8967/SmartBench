## UX Documentation Overview

This section contains all user experience design documentation, including user analysis, navigation structure, and front-end specifications. These documents inform the UI/UX implementation and component development.

## Core UX Documents

### Analysis & Research

- **[UX Analysis](./ux-analysis.md)** - Comprehensive analysis of user personas, goals, pain points, and key user flows
  - User personas (Borrower, Lender, Worker, Supervisor, Solopreneur)
  - Pain points addressed
  - 7 key user flows mapped
  - Cross-persona interactions
  - Critical design constraints

### Navigation & Information Architecture

- **[Navigation Structure](./navigation-structure.md)** - Complete information architecture and navigation structure
  - Sidebar navigation pattern (desktop, tablet, mobile)
  - Role-based navigation sections
  - Detailed navigation hierarchy
  - Mobile navigation behavior
  - Context switching for multi-company users
  - Quick actions and floating elements

### Front-End Specification

- **[Front-End Specification](./front-end-specification.md)** - Complete front-end specification with wireframes and components
  - Design system (colors, typography, spacing, shadows)
  - Layout structure
  - Component specifications (10 core components)
  - Screen wireframes (5 key screens)
  - Interaction patterns
  - Responsive breakpoints
  - Accessibility specifications

## UX Process

The UX documentation follows this process:

1. **UX Analysis** - Understanding users, goals, and flows
2. **Information Architecture** - Organizing features into navigation structure
3. **Front-End Specification** - Detailed wireframes and component design
